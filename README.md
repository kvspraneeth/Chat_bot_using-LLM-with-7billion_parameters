The file cannot be executed in Normal PCs.
As the model size is too heavy(10GB+5GB) included with pytorch & safe tensors, to execute the file, GPU is needed.
I built the model in Colab Pro environment using Nvidia A100 GPU on high RAM.
Recommended to run the model on GPUs with similar or even higher benchmark scores.
